#  Bat Scratch To Pi Quest 3 Int Sync In Van

For a client project, I need to write some code, ensure it is production-ready, document it, and perform stress testing. So let's create a step-by-step guide.   (In short, it's a **Quest multiplayer game** üéÆ played by **four players** in the same small space, using **time and integers** connected to a **Raspberry Pi**. üïπÔ∏è In short... (^^' )  )

As I will be teaching how to build an XR game right after this project in Charleroi, I am going to use this opportunity to create a step-by-step video guide for the workshop with the students. 

Bat Scratch ? What ?

In scratch I build in the past a small game in half an hours using the cloud var system provided by the website.
The is 40 blocks long... Ridiculusely short program... It fit in the screenshot.
The concept is simple, first to click on the Bat make it disapared for everybody and win a point.

If I can provide a integer websocket server on a Raspberry Pi that allows to play and monitor this game for four player in small mapped space like inside a van and have the documentation on how to setup and update the all.
Then I check all the checkbox of what is asked to me in my current client project.

So if you want to learn to make this kind of game in Quest 3 then make your own based on what you learn. You are more that welcome.
